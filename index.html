        <p class="lead mb-4"> I'm Michelle Akalon. I am currently a second year, with an undeclared major in the school of CHASS. I have finished all my required CHASS breadth courses, including the obscure classes that most CHASS students don't really take like entomology and geology because I thought they were super fun. In entomology I researched the evoloution of multiple insect species, but narrowed down on the Red Fire Ant for my research proposal. Red fire ants to me were the most interesting as they are an insect that one could find outside on a daily basis, despite how they are moderately dangerous. Red fire ant mounds are common found on campus, and it would be wise to ignore them when seen. If not, red fire ants can get very agressively, and become a danger to those surrounding them.   <br><br>
        
        I should probably switch my major soon and have a good talk with my advisor. I have done very little so I have no assets or achievements to brang about or put on a resume. My GPA is great so I guess thats one thing, as well as all the classes I've taken if those can somehow help me get any job position. When I talkn to my advisor I'll probably switch to being a biology major but I'll have alot of extra courses to do that I don't really look forward to. I don't know what else to write I"m so sorry. Cherry-flavored motivation...sumn sumn sumn... Actualy let me talk about the start-up I was part of because that was really cool.<br><br>

        I graduated highschool in 2021. During that summer I worked for a non-profit that helped relocate worn clothes to impoverished cities in America and in Africa. After that I applied to several internships and finally landed one in San Francisco where I became a sales tech at a start-up companing that was seeking to broaden their company. At my internship I learned how to code and manage the online system, and helped curate schedules for my fellow interns and also the workers at the companmy. I learned the ins and outs of the business and how to monitor sales properly. Occasionally I wwent out with the CEO of the company and toured around other companies where the CEO attempted to make deals with other start-ups to merge their companies together. Eventually another company agreed to the merge and the companies began to adopt each others workers and transition into a larger company. During my internship, I worked several hours a day, and came into the company about six times a week. On Monday I organized the schedules for the interns and the workers and logged everyones hours into the systems, and also decided the amount of hours and what days to give them based on their previous schedules. On Tuesdays my work consisted mainly of excel spreadsheets as well as organizing powerpoint presentations for the company. I wouild proofread, mark areas that seemed dull, and suggest ideas to add to the powerpoint to get the point of the powerpoint across more clearly and concisely.
